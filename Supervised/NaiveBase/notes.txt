
Naive Bayes Algorithm
......................

It is a supervised machine learning Algorithm
Used for classification
works based on probability
uses Bayes theorem
Need conditional probabilityto learn bayes theorem


probability : Chances of occurance

Coin toss : Head==> 1/2    Tail==> 1/2
Die toss  : 1 ==> 1/6 2==>1/6 3==> 1/6


conditional probability : probability of a event occuring even though an event has occured

navie baies algo consists of 3 classifiers
1. Gausian      : for continuous data
2. Multinomial  : for discrete data
3. Burnouli
